	<h3>Programming Courses</h3>
	<p> I have taught a lot of students in private classes. Most classes were about the Python, Java, and C++ programming languages. I achieved a wide range of experiences during this period of time.</p>
    <h3>Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Courses</h3>
	<p>I have held some classes for students with master's or even Ph.D. degrees and I have learned a lot of things during teaching these concepts. I personally believe if somebody wants to learn something accurately and deeply, he should try teaching it.</p>
	<p>I was also a lecturer in the OstadBank. You can have a look of my <a href="https://www.ostadbank.com/tutor/tc95030045">profile</a>.
