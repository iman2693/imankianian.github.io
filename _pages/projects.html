          In this project, I embark on a journey to enhance Persian language understanding through state-of-the-art machine learning.
          My core objective revolves around accurately labeling each word in Persian text with its corresponding part of speech,
          a fundamental task in natural language processing. By leveraging a meticulously curated dataset of Persian texts,
          I employ a range of machine learning models, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Perceptron,
          and Logistic Regression, to decode the grammatical structure of Persian sentences. My project's success hinges on comprehensive feature engineering,
          innovative feature selection techniques, and meticulous model evaluation, ensuring that our POS tagging model meets the highest standards of accuracy
          and precision.

      <h1>Parkinson's Disease Classification</h1>
      <p><strong>Project Date</strong>: June 2022</p>
      <p><em>Data Mining Course's Mini-Project</em></p>
      <p>
          Parkinson's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that profoundly affects a
          person's ability to move and leads to symptoms like tremors, slowness of movement, and muscle
          rigidity. Timely diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management, and this project
          seeks to contribute to that goal by employing cutting-edge data analysis techniques. I embark on an exciting
          exploration of various machine learning algorithms, each with its unique strengths and
          characteristics. These include Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines,
          and Random Forests. Through rigorous experimentation and cross-validation, I fine-tune these
          algorithms to achieve optimal performance, ensuring they are finely attuned to the nuances of
          Parkinson's disease classification. Recognizing the complexity of my dataset, I implement Principal
          Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce its dimensionality while preserving vital information.
          The outcomes of this endeavor hold the promise of significantly improving the lives of
          individuals affected by Parkinson's disease by enabling swifter and more accurate
          diagnosis and management.

      <p><strong>Project Date</strong>: November 2021</p>
      <p><em>Information Retrieval Course's Mini-Project</em></p>
      <p>In the realm of natural language processing, understanding sentiment expressed in text is a
          pivotal challenge. This project presents a Python solution to this problem by
          implementing sentiment analysis using a Naive Bayes classifier. Sentiment analysis,
          often called opinion mining, revolves around the task of discerning the sentiment
          or emotional tone embedded within text, such as tweets.
          This project encompasses two primary datasets: the SandersPosNeg dataset and OMD. The SandersPosNeg dataset features tweets categorized as
          either positive or negative sentiment, with a Naive Bayes classifier achieving an
          accuracy of approximately 82.9%. Meanwhile, the OMD dataset,
          processed through the same steps, yields an accuracy of around 76.3%.

      <h1>Travelling Salesman Problem</h1>
      <p><strong>Project Date</strong>: October 2021</p>
      <p><em>Bio Computing Course's Project</em></p>
      <p>The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization puzzle involving
          finding the shortest route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting
          point. In my project, I've successfully tackled this challenge using two distinct
          algorithms: the Genetic Algorithm and the Self-Organizing Map (SOM).

          The Genetic Algorithm harnesses principles of natural selection to evolve and refine
          potential routes over successive generations. By employing a population of routes,
          combining them through crossover and mutation operations, and favoring shorter paths,
          this algorithm efficiently converges towards an optimal or near-optimal solution to the TSP.
          In contrast, the Self-Organizing Map, an artificial neural network technique, organizes
          cities on a grid based on similarity, aiding route optimization. Your project showcases
          how these innovative algorithms can effectively solve the TSP, demonstrating your prowess
          in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology.

      <p>Job Assignment is the vital process of matching tasks with the most suitable individuals 
        or resources, impacting fields like employee task distribution and logistics route planning,
         essential for optimizing operations and productivity. In this context, <strong>Ant Colony Optimization</strong>
         , inspired by ant foraging behavior, offers a potent algorithmic 
         approach. Artificial ants explore solutions, leaving pheromone-like trails that guide
          further exploration, making ACO a powerful tool for optimizing job assignments, 
          particularly in complex, large-scale scenarios across various domains. In this Project I solved
          Job Assignment using <strong>ACO</strong>.

      <p><strong>Project Date</strong>: December 2021</p>
      <p><em>Bio Computing Course's Project</em></p>
      <p>The Cutting Stock Problem is a classic optimization challenge encountered in industries
         like manufacturing and paper production. It involves determining the most efficient way
          to cut large rolls or sheets of material, such as metal, paper, or fabric, into smaller 
          pieces to meet customer demand while minimizing waste. The objective is to find the optimal 
          cutting pattern that minimizes the total number of rolls or sheets used.
          <strong>Simulated Annealing</strong> is a versatile optimization technique inspired by the annealing 
        process in metallurgy. Just as heated metal cools and forms a crystal structure with
         minimal defects, Simulated Annealing iteratively explores potential solutions while 
         gradually decreasing the "temperature" parameter, allowing the algorithm to escape 
         local optima and converge towards a global optimum. In this project I solved this problem using <strong>Simulated Annealing</strong>.

         of both humans and machines. It challenges us to place N chess queens on an N.N chessboard
          in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. As N grows, the puzzle's complexity
           explodes, making it a formidable problem for traditional methods. In this exploration,
            I delve into the world of <strong>Memetic Algorithms</strong>, a hybrid optimization technique merging 
            genetic algorithms and local search heuristics. My journey uncovers their effectiveness 
            in taming the N-Queens puzzle, efficiently navigating the labyrinthine solution space to
             find elegant solutions for boards of varying sizes.
